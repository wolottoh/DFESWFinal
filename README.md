# DFESWFinal

##	Why are we doing this? 
We are diong this project for the purpose of comprehension. Firstly of the tools used in the creation of Java projects and builds,
and then in the understanding of the code that is use in performing integration testing. Thirdly is for the understanding in the usage of git and github. GitHub as a
cloud-based code hosting platform to help developers store, manage, track and control changes to their code; as a platform used for collaboration and version control.
Git on the otherhand is the command prompt used to interact between Github and a local copy of the code. An also for the understanding in the use of Jira as
a project management tool in the creation of product baclogs, tasks, user stories that can be tracked in sprints.

###	How I expected the challenge to go.
I expect the challenge to be difficult as this would be the first time I will actually be creating a Java project that will be evaluated based on my understanding, 
and the application of the the specifications given.

#### What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
I was stuck when I could not get the code for the readAll Animal objects working. Also at the start of the project, I encounter breakdown with my internet connection and this actuallaly
blocked me from progressing with the project for a considerable period of time. However, against all the above shortcomings, I had a fantastic trainer Anoush Alowton who gave an 
unflinching support throughout the project.


#####	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
The project can be further improved through the implementation of the principles of Polymorphism, Abstraction,Inheritance. Also with the application of SOLID principles.
